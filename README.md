# ANC-Project
Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) Using LMS Algorithm

Designed and implemented an adaptive noise cancellation system in MATLAB to remove noise from audio signals using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm.
Generated reference noise signals, applied adaptive filtering, and analyzed the performance of the system.
Visualized and compared noisy and denoised audio signals using time-domain plots.
Gained hands-on experience with MATLABâ€™s audio processing tools (audioread, sound, dsp.LMSFilter) and adaptive filtering techniques.
